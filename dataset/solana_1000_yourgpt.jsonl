It provides a higher level of security than trusting a remote validator without requiring excessive resource expenditure for verifying the ledger."}
{"instruction":"","input":" How can light clients verify transaction inclusion proofs?","output":" Light clients need to track incoming block headers and determine the ancestry relationship between two bank hashes to verify transaction inclusion proofs. This allows them to infer the topology of forks in the network and confirm the legitimacy of transactions."}
